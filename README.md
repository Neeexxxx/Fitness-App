# Welcome to the Fitness App 

This application was made using the Flutter framework.
The objective of this app is to help users get fit.

## Problem Statement –  
> It was observed that the overall all health of the general public was not up to the mark,  
especially during the lockdown period. The past few years have introduced a significant change  
in the lifestyle of most people. In some cases, it was also followed by mental stress and anxiety.  
If left unchecked for a long time, it might turn out to be fatal for the concerned person.  
To tackle this, we are introducing an interactive cross-platform mobile application to monitor  
and improve one’s physical and mental health.

### *Lack of guidance or tutorials* — 
In most of the applications they will just provide you with the name of an exercise that you  
have to perform on your own without a proper expert performing it results in injuries to the user.

### *Customization of diet* — 
In most cases, people don’t have a proper clue about diet and just follow the routine provided on  
Google or YouTube and since the diet is based on a certain individual it doesn’t work for every person  
with different weights and heights and ages usually resulting in something fatal.
